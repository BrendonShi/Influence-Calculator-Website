### What is "Influence"?
The "Influence" score is designed to quantify the impact of a subset of data on the overall average. It answers the question: "How much does the average change when I only consider these specific data points?"

It's a powerful way to spot outliers or understand the weight of certain data clusters within your set. The formula used is:

$$ \text{Influence} = \frac{|\text{Subset Average} - \text{Total Average}|}{|\text{Total Average}|} \times 100% $$

This provides a clear percentage, showing how much your selection pulls the overall average up or down.
